## Solution
1. I opened the link and it showed me a simple html page.

2. Left half of the page was showing one flag and a dropdown to select the the country. The flag changes as I select the country. There was a text "We say Hello world in United States" above the USA flag.
3. Right half of the page contains another dropdown to select country and below the dropdown, it translates "Hello world" to the language of the selected country. There was the country flag below the translated text.
4. I was going through all the options in the dropdown and found an option "Flagistan".

5. I selected "Flagistan" in the right half and it showed me the flag.
